# DOML (DOML's Obnoxious Micro Language)

A truly pointless language, with no useful constructs.

## Example

```
🏁
    ✌️key✌️ ▶️value◀️
    ✌️array_key✌️ ⏩
        ▶️Irritating◀️
        ▶️Language◀️
    ⏪
🛑
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	
	"doml.lol/go-doml"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(doml.Parse("🏁✌️key✌️▶️value◀️🛑"))
}
```

## *Disclaimer*

*This language was not made by DOML and is not supported by anyone, for any reason... least not DOML himself... Unless he wants to, of course*.
